# esoTalk Finnish translation (Beta)

Finnish language pack for the esoTalk forum. All of the translations are done but it still needs some spit and shine.

If you have suggestions on how to improve the translations, please do not hesitate to contact me. Creating a GitHub issue is the preferred way.

## How to install

### Method 1: Clone the repository

1. Open up your terminal / command prompt and `cd` to `addons/languages`

### Method 2: Download the repository as an archive

2. Click the `Download ZIP` button on the right column

4. Rename the `Finnish-master` folder to `Finnish` and move it to `addons/languages` folder on the server

### Method 3: Wait for the official release

Once I get this done I will make an official zip package that you can download.
